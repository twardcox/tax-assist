# IRS Form Field Map — Tax Year 2025
# Verified via markitdown + visual inspection

> **REVISION GUARD:** The IRS re-publishes form PDFs at the same URL, and a new
> revision can renumber AcroForm fields (the "Created 9/5/25" Form 1040 revision
> shifted every index after f1_53/f2_06 and invalidated the previous mapping).
> This map is valid only for the exact PDFs whose sha256 prefixes are pinned in
> `backend-ts/scripts/checkFieldMappings.mjs` — that script exits immediately if
> a cached PDF no longer matches. If the cache refreshes to a new revision,
> re-derive the mapping (FORM_MAPPING_PROCESS.md) before trusting any output.

### Filing Status Checkboxes — CORRECTED 2026-06-11
Left column (Single/MFJ/MFS) are inside Checkbox_ReadOrder subform; right column (HOH/QSS) are top-level.

| Field (full path) | Y,X pos | Form Label | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Checkbox_ReadOrder[0].c1_8[0] | 206, 98 | Single | ✓ FIXED |
| Checkbox_ReadOrder[0].c1_8[1] | 218, 98 | Married filing jointly | ✓ FIXED |

Previously wrong mappings (OLD → these were Presidential Campaign / main-home checkboxes):
- c1_5[0] (Y=147, X=568) = "main home in U.S." checkbox — NOT Single
- c1_6[0] (Y=194, X=482) = Presidential Campaign "You" — NOT MFJ
- c1_7[0] (Y=194, X=526) = Presidential Campaign "Spouse" — NOT MFS

### Dependents — CORRECTED 2026-06-12
Table layout: **rows = field type**, **columns = dependents 1–4**.
Row1=first names, Row2=last names, Row3=SSNs, Row4=relationships.

| Field (full path) | Form Label | Data Key |

| Row1[0].f1_31[0] | **Dep 1** first name | `name.split[0]` |
| Row1[0].f1_32[0] | **Dep 2** first name | `name.split[0]` |

| Row3[0].f1_40–f1_42 | Dep 2–4 SSNs | same pattern |
| Row4[0].f1_43[0] | Dep 1 relationship | `relationship` |
| Row4[0].f1_44–f1_46 | Dep 2–4 relationships | same pattern |
| Row5.Dependent1.c1_12[0] | Dep 1 lived with you (Yes) | `lives_with_taxpayer` |
| Row6.Dependent1.c1_20[0] | Dep 1 full-time student | `full_time_student` |
| Row7.Dependent1.c1_28[0] | Dep 1 child tax credit | `age_at_year_end < 17` |
| Row7.Dependent1.c1_28[1] | Dep 1 other dependent credit | `age_at_year_end >= 17` |

### Income Checkboxes — CORRECTED 2026-06-12
Income checkboxes c1_33–c1_44 map to Lines 3c, 4c, 5c, 6c, 6d, 7b in order (2+3+3+1+1+2 = 12).
Tab order does not match visual reading order, but the visual grouping is definitive.

## Schedule D (f1040sd.pdf)
Verified via live AcroForm field dump 2026-06-16 (pdf-lib, fields read directly — no markitdown
text-extraction ambiguity). Test values: stcg=7,070 ltcg=8,080 total=15,150.
Two stale annotations fixed: f1_42[0] is NOT filled by the code — it's Line 14 (long-term capital
loss carryover), which this test user has none of, so it's correctly blank. The actual "net
long-term gain/(loss)" output is Line 15 (f1_43[0]). Also Page 2 field is `f2_1[0]`, not `f2_2[0]`.
